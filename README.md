# Blackjack
Simple text-based Blackjack in Python. The goal was to get some experience with functions, and interactivity.

This program plays a game of blackjack between yourself and a very simple dealer. You are able to double down, stand, split and draw. Insurance is currently in development.

I will likely be rewriting this from scratch instead of refactoring as it is.
